## **How to Install and Test the App:**

1. Install the app on your development store using this App URL:
   **[https://acm-fought-patch-thunder.trycloudflare.com/auth/login](https://acm-fought-patch-thunder.trycloudflare.com/auth/login)**
   *(Enter your Shopify store domain to authenticate and install from this URL.)*

2. Set up the **Theme App Extension** in the **host theme** on the **Product Page**.

3. Preview your **Theme App Extension** in the development store.

## **Important Notes:**

* This app is running on a **local server**, and the app URL changes every time the server restarts.

* After every server restart, the **new app URL** must be updated in the **Shopify Partner Proxy settings**.

* When the app is deployed, the proxy gets removed, so during development, make sure to inform me before testing.
  I will restart the server and update the proxy URL accordingly.

* **Current App Proxy URL:**
  **[https://sms-mf-joshua-manufacturing.trycloudflare.com/api/server](https://sms-mf-joshua-manufacturing.trycloudflare.com/api/server)**

## **Data Flow Overview:**

### **1. Admin (App Backend):**

* Merchant sets or updates a product review using the app’s admin panel.
* The review is stored in the app’s database (e.g., via **Prisma**).

---

### **2. Storefront Extension (Theme Block + JS):**

* The product page contains a block with a JS script.
* This script fetches the review for the current **product** and **shop**.

---

### **3. App Proxy:**

* The JS script sends a fetch request to the **Shopify App Proxy endpoint** (e.g., `/apps/review`).
* Shopify securely forwards this request to your **backend API**.

---

### **4. Backend API:**

* The API receives the request.
* It queries the database for the matching **shop** and **productId** review.
* Returns the review data as **JSON**.

---

### **5. Frontend Display:**

* The JS script renders the fetched review inside the **product page block**.
* If the **proxy fails** (e.g., during development), it falls back to the app’s **direct URL**.
